                                When forming a new team in 2021, students were given the option to choose a new name.
                                They unanimously chose to retain
                                the name and colors of their previous team. To differentiate the new organization, the
                                name was shortened to simply
                                <strong>Mayhem</strong>, without the original acronym.

                                Mayhem (FRC 8724) was founded in the fall of 2021. Many of the founding students
                                previously participated on another
                                FIRST Robotics team that did not continue after the pandemic. With the support of
                                parents, mentors, and FIRST New Hampshire
                                senior mentors, the students formed a new community-based team.

                                The team began with limited funding and inherited equipment, relying heavily on
                                volunteer support and community sponsorship.
                                Mayhem Robotics was subsequently formed as a nonprofit to ensure long-term
                                sustainability and growth.

                                No prior robotics, programming, or engineering experience is required. Students learn
                                through hands-on projects, mentorship,
                                and collaboration with peers. Curiosity, a willingness to learn, and a positive attitude
                                are far more important than previous experience.
